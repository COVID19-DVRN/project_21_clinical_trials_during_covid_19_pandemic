0,Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT),Interventional,"This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with
      COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100
      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a
      control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping
      for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this
      treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).
      Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards
      of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful
      management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from
      concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to
      study arms.

      The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a
      ""recovered"" status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those
      subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity
      subgroup (those with baseline status of ""Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen"" or
      ""Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care"") is also
      of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20,
      2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With
      recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.

      Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the
      hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For
      discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain
      safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as
      well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the
      ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be
      conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have
      laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.

      All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety
      laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs
      will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).
      OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and
      29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).

      The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates
      treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known
      about the clinical course of COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size
      reassessment.

0,Methylprednisolone for Patients With COVID-19 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,Observational [Patient Registry],"Comparison of two groups of patients SARS-CoV-2 positive with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome:

        1. Exposed to low prolonged doses of Methylprednisolone

        2. Not exposed to corticosteroids (standard of care alone)

      The two group will be weighted by means of a propensity score according to:

        1. Sex

        2. Age

        3. C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline

        4. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at baseline

        5. PaO2/FiO2 ratio at baseline (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional
           inspired oxygen)

      Anti-viral agents, chloroquine, respiratory support (any), and antibiotics (any) are allowed
      in each study group. Corticosteroids use, other than per-protocol Methylprednisolone in the
      exposed group is a reason for dropout.

        1. The exposed group is treated with Methylprednisolone at study entry (baseline) according
           to a protocol based on the Italian national recommendations for COVID-19 management: a
           loading dose of 80 mg IV, followed by an infusion of 80 mg/day in 240 mL normal saline
           at 10 mL/h. The infusion is continued for at least eight days and until achieving either
           a PaO2:FiO2 > 350 mmHg or a CRP < 20 mg/L. Treatment is then switched to oral
           administration of Methylprednisolone 16 mg or 20 mg IV twice daily until CRP returns to
           < 20% of normal range and/or PaO2:FiO2 > 400 or SatHbO2 ≥ 95%. The decision to apply the
           protocol to Covid-19 is left to the discretion of the treating team for each individual

0,Bidirectional Oxygenation Valve in the Management of Pulmonary Complications of COVID-19,Interventional,"Severe cases of COVID-19 often mimic the typical course of Adult Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome (ARDS) and its predictable sequelae. These patients often require intubation and
      ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is
      intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in
      order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and
      improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians
      treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many
      cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival.

      PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in
      the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting
      and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one
      of the safest ways to increase partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and is used on almost all
      modern ventilator settings.

      The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a
      bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of
      the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save
      lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially
      ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to
      improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.",All,18 Years,N/A,No,N/A,Single Group Assignment,Supportive Care,None (Open Label),GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE,,,,,,2,,,,2,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,2,,,1,,,1,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,1,,,0,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,USEFULNESS of Topic Ivermectin and Carrageenan to Prevent Contagion of Covid 19,Observational,"CONTAGION COURSE Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel
      coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic
      potential of this disease.

      Observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a
      networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical
      epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of
      undocumented infections and their contagiousness, have been attempted. The rapid geographic
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly
      challenging.

      DISSEMINATION BY DROPLETS For COVID-19, the salivary gland could be an important source of
      the virus in saliva and would generate infectious saliva on a sustained basis.

      ACE2 expression in the minor salivary glands was higher than in the lungs, suggesting that
      the salivary glands is a potential target for COVID-19.

      The positive rate of COVID-19 in the patients' saliva can reach 91.7%, and the saliva samples
      can also culture the live virus.

      In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the
      Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6
      feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we
      usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies
      support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person.
      Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared
      with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and
      that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed,
      there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to
      its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available
      knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing
      the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission
      sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out
      inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the
      hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has
      to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in
      analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th,
      we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional
      factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of
      the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM)
      concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis
      of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than
      two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an
      effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.

      IVERMECTIN CONCENTRATION IN SALIVARY GLANDS The concentration of ivermectin was tested in
      different tissues, in different studies, both in animals and human beings. The concentration
      in salivary glands proved to be adequately acceptable.

      CARRAGEENAN VIRUCIDAL EFFECTS Iota Carrageenan is widely used in gastronomic, cosmetic and
      pharmacologic industry.

      Recently, its intrinsic virucidal effectas were proved over a variety of virus (herpes
      simplex, Japanese Encephalitis, Rhinovirus, etc.).

      Its mechanism of action is preventing virus adsorption to host cells. By applying both drugs

      oligosymptomatic. This fact will not give rise to the consult, and will directly affect a
      notorious sub-registration of the cases.

      The second, even more disturbing, premise is that these patients are as contagious as the
      moderate and severe cases.

      The virus incubation period has been calculated at 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and
      97.5% of patients are said to have symptoms at 11 days (95% CI 8.2 to 15.6 days).

      Diagnostic confirmation is made through laboratory studies, which can be performed on a wide
      variety of biological samples.

      Bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed the highest sensitivity (93%), followed by sputum
      samples (72%), nasal swabs (63%), fiberoptic brush biopsy (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%),
      feces ( 29%) and, finally, blood (1%). A sensitivity of 91% is reported in saliva samples.

      Evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe forms of COVID 19 may have cytokine
      storm syndrome.

      Therefore, we recommend the identification and treatment of hyperinflammation using existing
      approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce
      increasing mortality (see Therapeutic Proposal).

      Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH) is a poorly recognized hyperinflammatory
      syndrome characterized by fatal and fulminant hypercytokinemia with multiple organ failure.

      In adults, SHLH is most often triggered by viral infections, and occurs in 3.7-4.3% of sepsis
      cases.

      The cardinal features of sHLH include constant fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia;
      Pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in approximately 50% of patients.

      A cytokine profile that resembles sHLH is associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease,
      characterized by an increase in interleukin (IL) -2, IL-7, granulocyte colony stimulating
      factor, protein 10 inducible by interferon-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein, macrophage
      inflammatory protein 1-α and tumor necrosis factor-α.

      Mortality predictors from a recent multicenter retrospective study of 150 confirmed cases of
      COVID-19 in Wuhan, China included elevated ferritin (mean 1297.6 ng / ml in non-survivors
      versus 614.0 ng / ml in survivors; p <0.001) and IL-6 (p <0.0001), suggesting that mortality
      could be due to viral hyperinflammation.

      However, cases have been reported where tissue and organ involvement has been found whose
      concentration of ACE receptors is very dissimilar (myocardium, brain). In all of them, the
      common denominator was small vessel thrombosis, as seen in entities such as Catastrophic
      Antiphospholidic Syndrome.

      Currently the Virchow triad factors have been narrowed down in more detail:

      Circulatory stasis: abnormalities of hemorrheology and turbulence in vascular bifurcations
      and stenotic regions.

      Injury to the vascular wall: abnormalities in the endothelium, such as atherosclerosis and
      associated vascular inflammation.

      Hypercoagulable state: abnormalities in the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways and in
      platelet function associated with an increased risk of VTE and other cardiovascular diseases
      (such as coronary artery disease [CPA], heart failure and stroke in patients with AF). All
      lead to a state of hypercoagulability, which could explain the formation of microthrombosis
      in different locations, as has been repeatedly reported in patients with COVID 19.

      BASES OF THE PROPOSED THERAPEUTICS They rest on four pillars: Ivermectin, Aspirin,
      Dexamentasone and Enoxaparin. IVERMECTIN Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic, with
      vermicidal and ectoparasiticidal properties. It was discovered and marketed for animal use in
      the early 1980s.

      Approved in 1997 by the FDA for single-dose strongyllidiasis of 200 mcg / kg and crusted
      scabies (Scabies Norway) in patients with AIDS at a dose of 200 mcg / kg, every week for 2
      weeks.

      In Argentina, it has been available for human use for almost 20 years. But, much more
      recently, its viricidal effects have been compiled on different varieties of flavivirus,
      dengue, Zica, Chikunguña, etc.

      Ivermectin has been reported to be a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. This activity is believed to be
      due to the dependence of many different RNA viruses on IMPα / β1 during infection. These
      reports suggested that the inhibitory activity of ivermectin nuclear transport may be
      effective against SARS-CoV-2, since they demonstrate that ivermectin has antiviral action
      against the clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with a single dose capable to control
      viral replication in 24-48 hours. in vitro.

      Although in vitro studies have used doses that -extrapolated to those recommended in the
      treatment of ectoparasitosis in humans- might seem high, the truth is that studies carried
      out in healthy volunteers, more than two decades ago, proved that the usual doses they can be
      increased tenfold, without significant side and / or adverse effects.

      ASPIRIN Aspirin is the common name for acetylsalicylic acid. The chemical production is based
      on the salicylic acid obtained by synthesis. Its most common uses and for what it was first
      used was as an analgesic (for pain), antipyretic (to lower fever) and anti-inflammatory. It
      is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). In 1989 the first large
      study was published that proved that Aspirin reduces cardiovascular risk, acting as an
      antiplatelet agent.

      These were low-dose Aspirin, and the risk of myocardial infarction was found to decrease by
      44% when the previously named dose of Aspirin was administered.

      HEPARIN AND ENOXAPARIN Heparins are injectable anticoagulant substances. A distinction should
      be made between standard heparin or unfractionated heparin (HNF) and low molecular weight
      heparins (LMWH).

      HNF is made up of a heterogeneous mixture of polysaccharide chains of variable length.

      LMWHs are the result of fragmentation of HNF by different methods to achieve products with
      lower and more homogeneous molecular weights. They are also made up of a mixture of
      polysaccharide chains and their average molecular weight is much lower. The antithrombotic
      and anticoagulant activity of HNF is related to the ability to inhibit factor Xa and factor
      IIa respectively. LMWHs have less inhibitory activity to thrombin or factor IIa but maintain
      the same potency with respect to factor Xa, so it is expected that they present a lower risk
      of bleeding but the same antithrombotic activity.

      CORTICOSTEROIDS Systemic corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
      agents. They can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, orally, intralesionally, and
      topically. Its side effects increase with high, long and frequent doses. Corticosteroids are
      drugs frequently used in various clinical situations, because they are powerful
      anti-inflammatories and immunomodulators. Glucocorticoids passively diffuse through the cell
      membrane, then join soluble receptor proteins in the cytoplasm. They are used, among others,
      for the treatment of some rheumatic diseases. A separate case, well known but not studied in
      the current contingency, is acute adrenal insufficiency.

      CURRENT IDEA TRIAL Based on the precedent data, we started a Clinical Trial based on the
      above-mentioned four drugs, on a gradual scale, and according the severity of each case. In
      order to determine the dose and combination, we developed our own Severity Score.

      INTERPRETATION:

      Mild cases Only minor criteria findings Moderate cases 3 major crit. findings, or 2 major + 2
      minor Severe cases 4 major crit. Findings or 3 major + 2/3 minor

      Based on the previous criteria, we used the following combinations and doses:

      DISEASE SEVERITY Firm Suspicious Case or Confirmed case 24 mg orally at a dose of 200 ug / kg
      in a single dose, to be repeated a week later Aspirin 250 mg orally Moderate clinical stage

0,Anti-Androgen Treatment for COVID-19,Interventional,"During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a
      significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42%
      vs 58%).Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be
      extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including
      cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in
      severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male
      androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and
      COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant
      variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.

      SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters
      pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral
      spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
      TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to
      SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro. Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of
      influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.

      The human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the
      only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated
      prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen
      receptor. Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is
      affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.

      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), often referred to as male pattern hair loss, is the most common
      form of hair loss among men. The development of androgenetic alopecia is androgen mediated
      and is dependent on genetic variants found in the androgen receptor gene located on the X
      chromosome; thus, it is hypothesized that men with AGA would be more prone to severe COVID-19
      disease. The investigators conducted a preliminary observational study of hospitalized
      COVID-19 patients at two Spanish tertiary hospitals between March 23-April 6, 2020 to test
      this theory. In total, 41 Caucasian males admitted to the hospitals with a diagnosis of
      bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range
      23-79). Among them, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with AGA (16 (39%) were classified as severe AGA
      (Hamilton IV or above)) and 12 (29%) did not present clinical signs of AGA. The diagnosis of
      AGA was performed clinically by a dermatologist. The precise prevalence of AGA among
      otherwise healthy Spanish Caucasian males is unknown; however, based on published literature,
      the expected prevalence of a similar age-matched Caucasian population is approximately
      31-53%.

      Based on the scientific rationale combined with this preliminary observation, the
      investigators propose to test an anti-androgen as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed
      with COVID-19.

      We have chosen the use of the novel second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist
      proxalutamide as a means for rapid reduction in AR activity. Proxalutamide (GT0918)
      demonstrates a dual mechanism of action. It is highly effective in inhibiting AR as well as
      exhibiting pharmacological effects of inducing the down-regulation of AR expression; the
      mechanism that is not present in bicalutamide and enzalutamide. Additionally, it has been
      reported that Proxalutamide lowers the expression of ACE2. Both would be beneficial for
      preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells.

      This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Provided anti-androgens are effective in reducing the rate of COVID-19
      hospitalization, subjects enrolled in this study may experience a lower rate of
      hospitalization.",Male,18 Years,N/A,No,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,"Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)",Standard Care,Proxalutamide + Standard Care,,,,,128,134,,,128,134,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,128,134,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This study is designed as a prospective, interventional, placebo controlled, double-blinded, randomized parallel assignment study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,128,134,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,Evaluation of Safety and Efficiency of Method of Exosome Inhalation in SARS-CoV-2 Associated Pneumonia.,Interventional,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This
      new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December
      2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries worldwide. Globally, as of 1:09 pm
      CEST, 27 July 2020, there have been 16 096 741 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 646 384
      deaths, reported to WHO.

      The main and rapidly achievable target of SARS-CoV-2 is lung type II alveolar cells (AT2),
      which determines the development of diffuse alveolar damage. In the pathogenesis of ARDS due
      to COVID-19, the main role is played by an over-response of the immune system with rapidly
      developing severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm). Cytokine
      release syndrome threatens the emergence and progression of ARDS. The key components of the
      pathogenesis of ARDS also include disruption of cell cytotoxicity mechanisms, excessive
      activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and macrophages with a massive release of proinflammatory
      cytokines (FNO-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), granulocytic colony-stimulating factor,
      monocytic chemoattractive protein 1), and inflammatory markers (CRP, serum ferritin),
      infiltration of internal organs and tissues by activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages,
      resulting in a hyperinflammatory reaction. Such severe lesions can lead to death or severe
      lung damage, including long rehabilitation after discharge.

      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may significantly
      reduce lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung
      injury. Many researchers connect the anti-inflammatory effect of MSC with their secretome
      which includes MSC derived exosomes. It is highly likely that MSC exosomes have the same
      therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves. Moreover, exosomes show a
      strong effect of regenerative stimulation on different wounds so the regenerative effect can
      be extended on patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

      The purpose of this protocol is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of

0,Clinical Trial of Ivermectin Plus Doxycycline for the Treatment of Confirmed Covid-19 Infection,Interventional,"OBJECTIVES:

      General objectives:

      To observe the benefit (clinical and microbiological) of Ivermectin and Doxycycline in
      Confirmed Covid 19 cases.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To observe the clinical outcome in trial group and the placebo group.

        2. To observe the duration require controlling viral replication (negative RT-PCR) in the
           trial and placebo group.

        3. To compare the outcome between the two groups.

      RATIONALE:

      Covid-19 is an emergent pandemic, threatens the life of millions of the people throughout the
      globe. There is increasing effort of the scientist to unveil a remedy of covid-19. Still it
      is unsuccessful. At present there is no other alternative other than experimenting the
      existent drug against the virus. There are several trials going throughout the globe. Among
      them Ivermectin showed good efficacy in vitro trial. Some clinical trial also proved it
      beneficial. The Doxycycline also has some anti viral role with its prominent
      anti-inflammatory role. Synergistic action of the two drugs might be proved some benefit in
      clinical trial. As both drugs are cheap and less toxic, if it does, it would be the blessing
      for the poor people of the globe.

      METHODOLOGY:

      Study type: Interventional Clinical trial Estimated enrollment: 200 participants per group

      For superior trial, the formula is:

      N=size per group; p=the response rate of standard treatment group; p0= the response rate of
      new drug treatment group; zx= the standard normal deviate for a one or two sided x; d= the
      real difference between two treatment effect; δ0= a clinically acceptable margin; S2= Polled
      standard deviation of both comparison groups.

      All parameters were assumed as follows: p =0.40; p0=0.58; α=0.05;β=0.20; δ=0.18; δ0=0.10.

      However, we are assuming that lost to follow up or refuse to include in trial will be 20%,
      that means 24. So at least 150 patients will be allocated randomly and power of this study
      will be 80%.

      group and the control group, took part in the study.

      Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for five days (9 mg between 36-50 kg, 12 mg between 51-65 kg, 15 mg
      between 66-79 kg and 200 microgram/kg in > 80 kg) in the form of a solution prepared for
      enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine (2x400mg loading
      dose followed by 2x200mg, po, 5 days) + favipiravir (2x1600mg loading dose followed by
      2x600mg maintenance dose, po, total 5 days) + azithromycin (first day 500mg followed by 4
      days 250mg/day, po, total 5 days)- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the
      control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin.

      The mutations in 29 pairs of primers in mdr1/abcab1 gene by sequencing analysis using Sanger
      method, and the haplotypes and mutations of the CYP3A4 gene that cause the function losing
      were investigated among the patients who meet criteria and who were included in the study
      group according to randomization. Mutation screening was done when the first dose of the
      research drug ivermectin was given, ivermectin treatment was not continued in patients with
      mutations detected as a result of genetic examination and these patients were excluded from
      the study.

      Patients were followed for 5 additional days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and
      follow-up period (At the end of 10th day), clinical response and changes in oxygenation and

0,Analysing the Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Dental Professionals Using the Turkish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 and Coronavirus Anxiety Scales,Interventional,"This cross-sectional study was conducted between October, 16 to 23, 2020 by sending an online
      survey questionnaire working in public and university hospitals, including general dentists
      or specialists. The tool utilized for data collection was a designed online Google Forms
      questionnaire.

      This survey was implemented by using a questionnaire that included socio-demographic data
      (age range, gender, marital status, systemic disease, professional area, years of clinical
      experience, number of patients treated daily, smoking status, alcohol consumption, vs),
      epidemic-related questions and scales measuring the fear and anxiety levels of the
      participants.

      Fear of COVID-19 Scale is an unidimensional scale seven-item scale assessing anxiety
      regarding COVID-19 developed by Ahorsu et al. Items are rated on a 5-item Likert scale from 1
      (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) with scores ranging from 7 to 35. A higher score of
      the FCV-19S represents a greater level of fear. In the study, the bi-factor model and
      two-factor model consisting of the ""emotional response"" factor (items 1, 2, 4, and 5) and
      ""physiological response"" factor (items 3, 6, and 7) were used.

      Coronavirus Anxiety Scale is an unidimensional tool that assesses the physiological reactions
      anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked to rate 5 items on a
      5-point Likert-type scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day over the last 2 weeks).",All,23 Years,N/A,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,N/A,Single Group Assignment,Other,None (Open Label),Analysing the Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic,,,,,,850,,,,813,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,813,,,0,,,553,,,260,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,813,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dental professionals,Dental professionals working in public and university hospitals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,813,,,37
