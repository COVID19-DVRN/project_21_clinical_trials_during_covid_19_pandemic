0,Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT),Interventional,"This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with
      COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100
      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a
      control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping
      for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this
      treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).
      Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards
      of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful
      management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from
      concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to
      study arms.

      The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a
      ""recovered"" status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those
      subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity
      subgroup (those with baseline status of ""Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen"" or
      ""Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care"") is also
      of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20,
      2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With
      recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.

      Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the
      hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For
      discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain
      safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as
      well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the
      ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be
      conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have
      laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.

      All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety
      laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs
      will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).
      OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and
      29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).

      The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates
      treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known
      about the clinical course of COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size
      reassessment.

0,Methylprednisolone for Patients With COVID-19 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,Observational [Patient Registry],"Comparison of two groups of patients SARS-CoV-2 positive with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome:

        1. Exposed to low prolonged doses of Methylprednisolone

        2. Not exposed to corticosteroids (standard of care alone)

      The two group will be weighted by means of a propensity score according to:

        1. Sex

        2. Age

        3. C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline

        4. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at baseline

        5. PaO2/FiO2 ratio at baseline (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional
           inspired oxygen)

      Anti-viral agents, chloroquine, respiratory support (any), and antibiotics (any) are allowed
      in each study group. Corticosteroids use, other than per-protocol Methylprednisolone in the
      exposed group is a reason for dropout.

        1. The exposed group is treated with Methylprednisolone at study entry (baseline) according
           to a protocol based on the Italian national recommendations for COVID-19 management: a
           loading dose of 80 mg IV, followed by an infusion of 80 mg/day in 240 mL normal saline
           at 10 mL/h. The infusion is continued for at least eight days and until achieving either
           a PaO2:FiO2 > 350 mmHg or a CRP < 20 mg/L. Treatment is then switched to oral
           administration of Methylprednisolone 16 mg or 20 mg IV twice daily until CRP returns to
           < 20% of normal range and/or PaO2:FiO2 > 400 or SatHbO2 ≥ 95%. The decision to apply the
           protocol to Covid-19 is left to the discretion of the treating team for each individual

      azithromycin (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients
      with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive active or placebo study treatment. The target
      sample size was 2000 participants, with approximately 1000 in each arm. Stratification was by
      ""high"" versus ""low"" risk of progression to severe COVID-19, where ""high risk"" was defined as
      a person age ≥60 years or having at least one of several specified comorbidities.

      Participants were prescribed study treatment for 7 days and were to be followed for an
      additional 24 weeks. Assessments on a subset of participants were planned to include blood
      collection, self-collected nasal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs.

      On June 23, 2020, sites were informed that the study was closing to follow-up due to slow
      enrollment and lack of community enthusiasm. Follow-up through week 24 was not completed for
      any participant. Participants were asked to complete the Day 20 visit and then were
      discontinued from the study. Due to the early termination, enrollment into the specimen
      collection subset did not occur, and results associated with those specimens are not

0,USEFULNESS of Topic Ivermectin and Carrageenan to Prevent Contagion of Covid 19,Observational,"CONTAGION COURSE Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel
      coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic
      potential of this disease.

      Observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a
      networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical
      epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of
      undocumented infections and their contagiousness, have been attempted. The rapid geographic
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly
      challenging.

      DISSEMINATION BY DROPLETS For COVID-19, the salivary gland could be an important source of
      the virus in saliva and would generate infectious saliva on a sustained basis.

      ACE2 expression in the minor salivary glands was higher than in the lungs, suggesting that
      the salivary glands is a potential target for COVID-19.

      The positive rate of COVID-19 in the patients' saliva can reach 91.7%, and the saliva samples
      can also culture the live virus.

      In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the
      Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6
      feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we
      usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies
      support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person.
      Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared
      with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and
      that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed,
      there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to
      its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available
      knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing
      the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission
      sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out
      inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the
      hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has
      to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in
      analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th,
      we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional
      factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of
      the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM)
      concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis
      of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than
      two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an
      effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.

      IVERMECTIN CONCENTRATION IN SALIVARY GLANDS The concentration of ivermectin was tested in
      different tissues, in different studies, both in animals and human beings. The concentration
      in salivary glands proved to be adequately acceptable.

      CARRAGEENAN VIRUCIDAL EFFECTS Iota Carrageenan is widely used in gastronomic, cosmetic and
      pharmacologic industry.

      Recently, its intrinsic virucidal effectas were proved over a variety of virus (herpes
      simplex, Japanese Encephalitis, Rhinovirus, etc.).

      Its mechanism of action is preventing virus adsorption to host cells. By applying both drugs
      topically, 5 times per day, in nasal and oral mucosae, we try to reduce contagion.",All,18 Years,N/A,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,,,,IVER+,IVER-,131,98,,,131,98,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,72,142,61,26,87,131,98,229,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,131,98,229,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

0,Anti-Androgen Treatment for COVID-19,Interventional,"During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a
      significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42%
      vs 58%).Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be
      extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including
      cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in
      severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male
      androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and
      COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant
      variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.

      SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters
      pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral
      spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
      TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to
      SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro. Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of
      influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.

      The human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the
      only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated
      prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen
      receptor. Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is
      affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.

      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), often referred to as male pattern hair loss, is the most common
      form of hair loss among men. The development of androgenetic alopecia is androgen mediated
      and is dependent on genetic variants found in the androgen receptor gene located on the X
      chromosome; thus, it is hypothesized that men with AGA would be more prone to severe COVID-19
      disease. The investigators conducted a preliminary observational study of hospitalized
      COVID-19 patients at two Spanish tertiary hospitals between March 23-April 6, 2020 to test
      this theory. In total, 41 Caucasian males admitted to the hospitals with a diagnosis of
      bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range
      23-79). Among them, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with AGA (16 (39%) were classified as severe AGA
      (Hamilton IV or above)) and 12 (29%) did not present clinical signs of AGA. The diagnosis of
      AGA was performed clinically by a dermatologist. The precise prevalence of AGA among
      otherwise healthy Spanish Caucasian males is unknown; however, based on published literature,
      the expected prevalence of a similar age-matched Caucasian population is approximately
      31-53%.

      Based on the scientific rationale combined with this preliminary observation, the
      investigators propose to test an anti-androgen as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed
      with COVID-19.

      We have chosen the use of the novel second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist
      proxalutamide as a means for rapid reduction in AR activity. Proxalutamide (GT0918)
      demonstrates a dual mechanism of action. It is highly effective in inhibiting AR as well as
      exhibiting pharmacological effects of inducing the down-regulation of AR expression; the
      mechanism that is not present in bicalutamide and enzalutamide. Additionally, it has been
      reported that Proxalutamide lowers the expression of ACE2. Both would be beneficial for
      preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells.

      This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Provided anti-androgens are effective in reducing the rate of COVID-19
      hospitalization, subjects enrolled in this study may experience a lower rate of
      hospitalization.",Male,18 Years,N/A,No,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,"Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)",Standard Care,Proxalutamide + Standard Care,128,134,,,128,134,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,128,134,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,"This study is designed as a prospective, interventional, placebo controlled, double-blinded, randomized parallel assignment study.",,,,,,,128,134,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,Clinical Trial of Ivermectin Plus Doxycycline for the Treatment of Confirmed Covid-19 Infection,Interventional,"OBJECTIVES:

      General objectives:

      To observe the benefit (clinical and microbiological) of Ivermectin and Doxycycline in
      Confirmed Covid 19 cases.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To observe the clinical outcome in trial group and the placebo group.

        2. To observe the duration require controlling viral replication (negative RT-PCR) in the
           trial and placebo group.

        3. To compare the outcome between the two groups.

      RATIONALE:

      Covid-19 is an emergent pandemic, threatens the life of millions of the people throughout the
      globe. There is increasing effort of the scientist to unveil a remedy of covid-19. Still it
      is unsuccessful. At present there is no other alternative other than experimenting the
      existent drug against the virus. There are several trials going throughout the globe. Among
      them Ivermectin showed good efficacy in vitro trial. Some clinical trial also proved it
      beneficial. The Doxycycline also has some anti viral role with its prominent
      anti-inflammatory role. Synergistic action of the two drugs might be proved some benefit in
      clinical trial. As both drugs are cheap and less toxic, if it does, it would be the blessing
      for the poor people of the globe.

      METHODOLOGY:

      Study type: Interventional Clinical trial Estimated enrollment: 200 participants per group

      For superior trial, the formula is:

      N=size per group; p=the response rate of standard treatment group; p0= the response rate of
      new drug treatment group; zx= the standard normal deviate for a one or two sided x; d= the
      real difference between two treatment effect; δ0= a clinically acceptable margin; S2= Polled
      standard deviation of both comparison groups.

      All parameters were assumed as follows: p =0.40; p0=0.58; α=0.05;β=0.20; δ=0.18; δ0=0.10.

      However, we are assuming that lost to follow up or refuse to include in trial will be 20%,
      that means 24. So at least 150 patients will be allocated randomly and power of this study
      will be 80%.

      Allocation: Randomized Intervention model: Parallel assignment Intervention model
      description: Patient will be randomized 1:1 to placaebo with standard care and combined
      doxycycline and ivermectin with standard care.

      Blinding: Double blind (The participant and the clinicians/data collectors will be unaware of
      the treatment the participant receives) Primary purpose: Treatment Official title: A phase
      III trial to promote recovery from covid 19 with combined Doxycycline and Ivermectin along
      standard care. Provider of placebo and active ingredients: Popular pharmaceutical limited
      Dosage of the drugs: Ivermactin 6 mg 2 tab stat, cap Doxycycline 100 mg 1 cap BD 5 days

      Data collection technique:

      Data will be collected by assigned. trained data collectors (Physician). Patient will be
      enrolled according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the current research.
      Informed written consent will be obtained from the patient or their relatives. Each patient
      participating in the trial will be uniquely identified, and information such as his name,
      address is recorded in the trial 'subject number list'. Only the principle investigator will
      be aware about the allocation of the drugs. The patients and the data collectors will be
      unaware about the group allocation of the drugs. The Data will be reviewed by the
      co-investigators. It will be managed by principle and co-principle investigators in
      designated computer.

      Clinical assessment (fever, cough, Anorexia, Temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory
      rate, oxygen saturation) will be done every day. Routine investigation (CBC, ESR, CRP,
      Creatinine, RBS, SGPT, chest x-ray, D- Dimer) will be done at admission and at day 3, 5, 7,
      10 and 14 day. In case of the clinical deterioration it would done according to necessity.
      RT-PCR will be done at day-0, Day 5, day 7 and day 14.

      Standard care: both the experimental and placebo will receive the available standard of care,
      like-

        -  Paracetamol, Antihistamine, Cough suppressant, Vitamins

        -  Oxygen therapy according to indication and need

        -  Low molecular weight heparin according to indication

        -  Appropriate other broad spectrum antibiotics

        -  Other drugs for associated co- morbid condition

      Management of the adverse events:

      Drugs adverse effect will be monitored by a defined committee. The patient experiencing
      adverse effect of the drugs will be discontinued from the study. It will be managed with
      priority to the highest possible level by the hospital authority as well as the
      investigators.

      If the patient progresses from mild to moderate or severe disease, the study will be
      continued and available management of the appropriate severity will be immediately started.
      The patient will be monitored closely.

      Data analysis:

      Data will be analyzed by computer with the help of SPSS (Statistical Package for Social
      Sciences) version 26. Unpaired t-test would be used for testing quantitative data and for
      testing qualitative data two sample z- test will be used. Comparing drug outcome in between
      two groups hazard ratio, Kaplan-Meire curve will be used.

0,Analysing the Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Dental Professionals Using the Turkish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 and Coronavirus Anxiety Scales,Interventional,"This cross-sectional study was conducted between October, 16 to 23, 2020 by sending an online
      survey questionnaire working in public and university hospitals, including general dentists
      or specialists. The tool utilized for data collection was a designed online Google Forms
      questionnaire.

      This survey was implemented by using a questionnaire that included socio-demographic data
      (age range, gender, marital status, systemic disease, professional area, years of clinical
      experience, number of patients treated daily, smoking status, alcohol consumption, vs),
      epidemic-related questions and scales measuring the fear and anxiety levels of the
      participants.

      Fear of COVID-19 Scale is an unidimensional scale seven-item scale assessing anxiety
      regarding COVID-19 developed by Ahorsu et al. Items are rated on a 5-item Likert scale from 1
      (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) with scores ranging from 7 to 35. A higher score of
      the FCV-19S represents a greater level of fear. In the study, the bi-factor model and
      two-factor model consisting of the ""emotional response"" factor (items 1, 2, 4, and 5) and
      ""physiological response"" factor (items 3, 6, and 7) were used.

      Coronavirus Anxiety Scale is an unidimensional tool that assesses the physiological reactions
      anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked to rate 5 items on a
      5-point Likert-type scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day over the last 2 weeks).",All,23 Years,N/A,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,N/A,Single Group Assignment,Other,None (Open Label),Analysing the Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic,,850,,,,813,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,813,,,0,,,553,,,260,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,813,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dental professionals,Dental professionals working in public and university hospitals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,813,,,37
